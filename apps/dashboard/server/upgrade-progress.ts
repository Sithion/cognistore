 * the startup self-heal), not just the ones that publish progress.
 *
 * Lives outside `server/index.ts` for the same reason as `mcp-entry.ts` and
 * `cleanup-routes.ts`: that module calls `start()` at import time, so anything
 * defined inside it boots a listening Fastify server and cannot be unit-tested.
 * This store carries real invariants (when the state may be reset, what is
 * allowed to escape it, which runs may be replayed), so it is worth testing
 * without booting anything — everything here is a pure function over explicit
 * inputs, with no `sdk`, no filesystem and no Fastify.
