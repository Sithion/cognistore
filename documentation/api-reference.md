# API Reference (Fastify Sidecar)

## Overview

The Fastify sidecar server exposes a REST API consumed by the React frontend. It binds `127.0.0.1` on a port in the 3210-3309 range.

## Token usage retention setting

Settings include `tokenUsageRetentionDays`: default 90, integer 0 through 36500;
zero retains raw usage forever. Maintenance deletes at most 5000 raw rows per
transaction and yields between batches. Invalid values use 90.

Daily totals remain permanent. Hourly and session detail uses retained raw rows.
Days follow the stored timestamp's lexical date prefix, including offsets.
Retained partial-day edges are exact; outside retention a partial-day edge
uses the whole rollup day and may overcount the requested hours.
NULL and empty-string projects remain distinct groups.
Existing token response fields are unchanged.

## Optional incremental vacuum upgrade

`POST /api/upgrade/run` accepts boolean `skipIncrementalVacuum`, default true.
Explicit false opts into a pending one-time rewrite, including on an already
current installation and after restart. Invalid types return 400 before replay
guards. An earlier default skip does not prevent later opt-in.
The `incremental-vacuum` progress step reports running and terminal status.
Mode-2 databases are not rewritten. Skipping this optional step leaves an
otherwise successful upgrade complete.
This applies on both the current-install opt-in and full-upgrade paths. Insufficient
free disk space or a database lock is reported as a warning; the opt-in rewrite
holds the database write lock, so close agent sessions before opting in.

## Background import

`POST /api/import` retains its request and response shapes.
Knowledge and plan imports run in the worker. Knowledge deduplication uses
indexed hashes and bounded repair rather than loading the entire table.
System import sanitization remains in force.

## Authentication

**Every route requires the sidecar token** (since v2.5.0). Loopback is not a trust boundary: any other local process, and any page served by any other local HTTP server, sits inside it — and `POST /api/uninstall` takes no body, so a body-less `fetch(..., {mode:'no-cors'})` from an ordinary web page was a CORS-simple request that ran the whole teardown.

Three checks, all of which must pass:

| Check | Rule |
|---|---|
| `x-cognistore-token` header | Must equal the sidecar's `SIDECAR_TOKEN`. |
| `Origin` (when present) | Must be this server's exact origin — `http://localhost:<PORT>`, `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` or `tauri:`. Any other localhost port is a foreign origin. |
| `Host` | Must be `localhost:<PORT>` or `127.0.0.1:<PORT>`, which defeats DNS rebinding. |

A **missing** `Origin` (curl, the Tauri shell, tests) is accepted only alongside a valid token — a browser cannot forge that header cross-origin.

Failures return **403** with `{ "error": "Forbidden" }`.

Exempt: static assets and the SPA shell, which the webview must fetch before any script of ours has run. The token is therefore delivered out of band, via a Tauri initialization script — it is never embedded in the served HTML, because anything there would be readable by any page on any other local port.

`GET /api/health` no longer returns the token. The shell proves the sidecar's identity over the child process's stdout instead.

**Errors:** in production, 5xx responses carry a generic message plus a `ref` correlation id; the detail is in `~/.cognistore/cognistore.log`. Input the SDK rejects (a `ValidationError`, e.g. `POST /api/knowledge` without `source`) is a **400**, not a 500. An unknown `/api/...` path is a **404** `{ "error": "Not found" }`; only non-API paths fall back to the SPA shell.

**Route inventory:** with `COGNISTORE_ROUTE_MANIFEST=<file>` the sidecar writes every route Fastify registered to that file once it listens. `packages/tests/src/api/sidecar-api.test.ts` reads it and fails on any `/api` route that no test names, and it sweeps every route for the token and Origin checks. A new route needs a test, and this file is the place for a plain call. The variable is for tests only; the shell never sets it.

**File:** `apps/dashboard/server/index.ts`

## Health & Status

### GET /api/health

Check database and Ollama connectivity.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "database": { "connected": true, "path": "~/.cognistore/knowledge.db" },
  "ollama": { "connected": true, "host": "http://localhost:11434" }
}
```

### GET /api/setup/status

Check if all setup components are installed and ready.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "node": true,
  "ollama": true,
  "database": true,
  "model": true,
  "mcpConfig": true,
  "sdkReady": true
}
```

## Knowledge CRUD

**System entry filtering:** All GET endpoints for knowledge entries automatically exclude `type=system` entries from results. System entries are managed exclusively by the setup/upgrade pipeline and are not visible in the dashboard.

### GET /api/knowledge/recent

List recent knowledge entries (excludes system entries).

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | number | 20 | Max entries to return |

**Response:** `KnowledgeEntry[]`

### POST /api/knowledge/search

Semantic search across knowledge entries.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "query": "React performance optimization",
  "tags": ["react"],
  "type": "pattern",
  "scope": "workspace:my-project",
  "limit": 10,
  "threshold": 0.3
}
```

All fields except `query` are optional.

This endpoint counts as real usage: every returned local entry has its `last_read_at` / `read_count`
updated (see [Database Layer](./database.md#knowledge_entries-relational-table)). The flag is forced
server-side and cannot be set or suppressed from the body. Browsing endpoints
(`GET /api/knowledge/recent`, `GET /api/knowledge/:id`) do not count as reads.

**Response (local only):** `{ entry: KnowledgeEntry, similarity: number }[]`

**Federated:** add `"includeExternal": true` (or `"providers": ["id", ...]`) to also query external
knowledge providers. When external search is active — including via the global
`alwaysSearchExternalProviders` setting — the response shape becomes:

```json
{
  "local": [{ "entry": {}, "similarity": 0.0 }],
  "external": [
    { "providerId": "company-wiki", "providerName": "Company Wiki",
      "results": [{ "title": "", "content": "", "url": "", "score": 0.0 }], "tookMs": 142 },
    { "providerId": "docs-mcp", "providerName": "Docs MCP",
      "results": [], "error": "timeout after 5000ms", "tookMs": 5001 }
  ]
}
```

Local results are ranked as before; external results stay sectioned by source (never merged). A failed
provider yields a section with `error` and `results: []`, isolated from local and other providers. See
[External Knowledge Providers](./providers/providers-config.md).

### GET /api/knowledge/:id

Get a single entry by ID.

**Response:** `KnowledgeEntry`

### POST /api/knowledge

Create a new knowledge entry.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "React.memo for list items",
  "content": "Use React.memo for expensive list items",
  "tags": ["react", "performance", "memo"],
  "type": "pattern",
  "scope": "global",
  "source": "code-review",
  "confidenceScore": 0.9,
  "agentId": "claude-code"
}
```

Required: `title`, `content`, `tags`, `type`, `scope`, `source`

**Response:** `KnowledgeEntry`

### PUT /api/knowledge/:id

Update an existing entry. Only include fields to change. Returns `403 Forbidden` if attempting to change `type` or `content` on a system entry (`type=system`).

**Body:**
```json
{
  "content": "Updated content",
  "tags": ["new", "tags"]
}
```

**Response:** `KnowledgeEntry`

### DELETE /api/knowledge/:id

Delete an entry and its embedding. Returns `403 Forbidden` if the entry has `type=system` (system entries are protected and cannot be deleted).

**Response:** `{ success: true }`

**Error (system entry):**
```json
{
  "error": "System knowledge entries cannot be deleted",
  "statusCode": 403
}
```

## Cleanup Reports

The periodic cleanup cycle proposes entries for removal and near-duplicate groups
for consolidation. **Nothing is deleted without an explicit approval call.**

Approving re-checks the entry still qualifies at that moment, so an entry that
was read, un-tagged or marked `keep` after the report was generated is skipped
rather than deleted. All mutating routes below reject requests from a foreign
`Origin`.

### GET /api/cleanup/report

The latest report with its candidates, plus the cleanup settings the UI renders.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "report": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "createdAt": "2026-08-04T16:15:11.180Z",
    "status": "open",
    "stats": {
      "unreadDays": 180,
      "dupThreshold": 0.92,
      "counts": { "deprecated": 1, "unread": 0, "duplicateGroups": 2, "removableEntries": 4 },
      "unreadGate": "read tracking started 0d ago; unread detection activates 2027-01-31"
    }
  },
  "candidates": [
    { "id": "uuid", "category": "deprecated", "entryIds": ["uuid"], "payload": { "title": "…" }, "status": "pending" }
  ],
  "settings": { "cleanupEnabled": true, "cleanupIntervalDays": 10, "cleanupUnreadDays": 180 }
}
```

`stats.unreadGate` is present when unread detection suppressed itself — either
read tracking is younger than the unread window, or no read has been recorded
recently (which is what an outdated MCP server looks like). `report` is `null`
when no report has ever been generated.

### GET /api/cleanup/pending-count

Just the number of pending candidates, for the dashboard banner to poll.

**Response:** `{ "pendingCount": 3 }`

### POST /api/cleanup/report/run

Generate a report now instead of waiting for the cycle. Idempotent: while a
report is open it is returned rather than duplicated.

**Response:** `{ "created": true, "report": { … } }`

### POST /api/cleanup/candidates/:id/preview

Draft the merged entry for a `duplicate_group` candidate so it can be reviewed.
Uses the local Ollama chat model, falling back to a deterministic concatenation
when the model is unavailable.

**The first call may download the model** (~2GB), so allow a long timeout.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "draft": { "title": "Merged title", "content": "Merged body" },
  "usedLlm": true,
  "tags": ["alpha", "beta"]
}
```

`tags` is advisory — the apply route recomputes them server-side from the
entries themselves, so a client cannot choose the merged entry's tags.

**Errors:** `400` for a non-duplicate candidate, `409` when fewer than two
members still exist.

### POST /api/cleanup/candidates/:id/approve

Apply a candidate: delete the entries (`deprecated` / `unread`), or merge the
group into its newest member and delete the rest (`duplicate_group`).

**Body — required for `duplicate_group` only:**
```json
{ "draft": { "title": "…", "content": "…" }, "usedLlm": true }
```

A consolidation **cannot** be approved without a draft: the merged text must be
one the user actually saw, since approving deletes the other members.

**Response:** `{ "deleted": 2, "skipped": 0, "errors": [] }` for removals,
`{ "canonicalId": "uuid", "deleted": 1, "errors": [] }` for consolidations.

**Errors:** `400` when a consolidation has no draft, `404` unknown candidate,
`409` when the candidate is no longer pending (already applied or dismissed by
another window) or the canonical entry changed since the report was generated.

### POST /api/cleanup/candidates/:id/dismiss

Decline a candidate. Only a pending candidate can be dismissed — dismissing an
applied one would erase it from the report's removal tally.

**Response:** `{ "dismissed": true }` · **Errors:** `404`, `409`

### POST /api/cleanup/report/:id/close

Seal a report. Remaining pending candidates are dismissed and the number of
entries actually removed while it was open is recorded.

**Response:** `{ "removed": 3 }`

A report left open for more than twice the configured interval is closed
automatically on the next cycle, so an ignored report cannot block future ones.

## Statistics & Metrics

### GET /api/stats

Aggregated entry counts.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "total": 150,
  "byType": [
    { "type": "pattern", "count": 45 },
    { "type": "fix", "count": 38 }
  ],
  "byScope": [
    { "scope": "global", "count": 80 },
    { "scope": "workspace:my-app", "count": 70 }
  ]
}
```

### GET /api/metrics

Detailed metrics for the stats dashboard.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "database": { "size": "2.4 MB", "path": "~/.cognistore/knowledge.db" },
  "activity": { "last24h": 12, "last7d": 45 },
  "activityByDay": [
    { "date": "2026-03-17", "count": 8 },
    { "date": "2026-03-16", "count": 4 }
  ],
  "heatmap": [
    { "date": "2026-03-17", "count": 8 },
    { "date": "2025-12-18", "count": 0 }
  ],
  "typeDistribution": [
    { "type": "pattern", "count": 45 }
  ]
}
```

- `activityByDay`: Last 15 days of activity
- `heatmap`: Last 90 days (daily counts for contribution heatmap)

### GET /api/tags

List all unique tags.

**Response:** `string[]`

## External Knowledge Providers

CRUD for `~/.cognistore/providers.json`. Secret **values** are never sent through these routes — only a
`secretRef`; values go to the OS keychain via the Tauri `set_provider_secret` command. See
[providers-config.md](./providers/providers-config.md) and [security.md](./providers/security.md).

### GET /api/providers

Read the current providers config.

**Response:** `{ "version": 1, "providers": ProviderEntry[] }`

### POST /api/providers

Add a provider (zod-validated `ProviderEntry`). Writes atomically (tmp + rename).

**Body:** a `ProviderEntry` (`id`, `name`, `kind`, `enabled`, and a matching `http` or `mcp` block).
**Response:** the created `ProviderEntry`.

### PUT /api/providers/:id

Update a provider (partial `ProviderEntry`).

**Response:** the updated `ProviderEntry`.

### DELETE /api/providers/:id

Remove a provider from the config.

**Response:** `{ "removed": boolean }` (the dashboard also clears the provider's keychain entry).

### POST /api/providers/:id/test

Instantiate the provider and run its `testConnection` (8 s timeout), then dispose it.

**Response:** `{ "ok": boolean, "message"?: string }`

## Setup Endpoints

### POST /api/setup/node

Install or detect Node.js v24.

### POST /api/setup/ollama

Install Ollama (brew on macOS, curl on Linux).

### POST /api/setup/ollama-start

Start `ollama serve` as background daemon. Waits up to 15 seconds for readiness.

### POST /api/setup/database

Create SQLite database with schema and indices.

### POST /api/setup/model

Pull `nomic-embed-text` embedding model via Ollama API.

### POST /api/setup/configure

Inject MCP configs, instruction markers, and AI skills into all supported clients.

### POST /api/setup/complete

Finalize setup and re-initialize the SDK.

## Upgrade

### POST /api/upgrade/run

Run the upgrade pipeline. Compares `~/.cognistore/.version` with the running app version. On mismatch, re-deploys all artifacts: database migrations, agent instructions (recompiled from `_base-instructions.md`), MCP configs, skills/hooks, OpenCode plugins, and system knowledge entries.

`~/.cognistore/.version` is written **only** when the app version is known and no step failed — a half-finished upgrade is not recorded as complete, and an unknown version is never persisted.

**Response (success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fromVersion": "2.4.0",
  "toVersion": "2.5.0",
  "results": [
    { "step": "database", "status": "success", "message": "Schema up to date" },
    { "step": "version", "status": "success", "message": "v2.5.0" }
  ]
}
```

`results[].status` is `success`, `warning`, `skipped` or `error`; `success` is `true` when every step is `success` or `warning`.

`results[].step` is one of the names in the `DeployStepName` union declared in `apps/dashboard/server/upgrade-progress.ts` — the source of truth for the step vocabulary. `reembed` and `integrity` are conditional (an embedding-dimension change and an embedding shortfall respectively), so a healthy upgrade emits nine steps and at most eleven.

**Already up to date:** before doing any work the handler re-reads `~/.cognistore/.version`, so a duplicate request — a second window, a StrictMode remount, or a request that just waited out an in-flight deploy — never repeats the upgrade:

- Marker already equals the running app version and an upgrade completed this boot with every step `success` or `warning` → returns that run's `results` verbatim (messages included), without repeating any work.
- Marker already equals the running app version but that run was **degraded** — a `skipped` step; `.version` is written whenever nothing hard-errored — → the upgrade **runs again**. A failed result is never replayed from the cache, so retrying stays meaningful (a `reembed` skipped because Ollama was still starting can succeed on the second attempt).
- Marker already equals the running app version and nothing ran this boot → returns

  ```json
  { "success": true, "noop": true, "fromVersion": "2.5.0", "toVersion": "2.5.0", "results": [] }
  ```

  Treat `noop` as "nothing to do", not as a completed upgrade with no steps.
- Otherwise the upgrade runs normally. This includes the case where the app version is unknown (`0.0.0`): nothing is ever short-circuited on an unresolved version.

**Concurrency:** if a deploy is already running (startup self-heal or `/api/redeploy`), the request **waits** for it and then applies the check above — the upgrade it was waiting for may well have been the one it wanted.

A `409 Upgrade already in progress` is returned only when another deploy holds the lock without an awaitable promise — in practice a concurrent `/api/redeploy`.

### GET /api/upgrade/progress

Live view of the upgrade `POST /api/upgrade/run` is performing, for a client that wants to show progress while it waits. Poll it (the upgrade screen polls every 750 ms).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "running": true,
  "startedAt": "2026-08-06T12:00:00.000Z",
  "fromVersion": "2.4.0",
  "toVersion": "2.5.0",
  "currentStep": "reembed",
  "steps": [
    { "step": "database", "status": "success" }
  ]
}
```

- `steps` mirrors the `results` of the in-flight run, **without `message`**. Step messages embed raw filesystem errors — absolute paths, and with them the OS username — plus template paths and the globally-installed MCP version. The projection stands on its own as disclosure hygiene (the endpoint is authenticated as of v2.5.0), so it publishes names and statuses only; the full messages come back with the `POST` response the app already consumes.
- `currentStep` names the phase about to run, and is `null` while the artifact steps run (they are published individually as they complete) and once the run ends.
- **No readiness guard:** this endpoint never returns `503`, deliberately — it has to answer while the `database` step has the SDK torn down. It reads in-memory state only.
- **Between runs** it keeps `running: false` with the previous run's `steps` still populated, so a client that connects late can still render what happened. `startedAt` identifies which run a snapshot describes: latch it to tell a fresh snapshot from a stale one. Before the first run of the process it answers `running: false` with `startedAt` and `fromVersion` `null` and `steps: []`; `toVersion` is always the running app version, run or no run.
- The startup self-heal deliberately publishes nothing here — only user-visible upgrades do.

### POST /api/redeploy

Re-deploy on-disk artifacts without touching the database, embeddings or the version markers: agent instructions, MCP configs, skills and global hooks. Shares the same `redeployArtifacts()` routine as `/api/upgrade/run` and the startup self-heal.

Missing templates are reported as `error` steps (the call no longer reports success regardless of outcome).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": [
    { "step": "instructions-claude", "status": "success" },
    { "step": "mcp-configs", "status": "success" }
  ]
}
```

Returns `409 A deploy is already in progress` when another deploy holds the lock.

### Startup self-heal

The sidecar re-deploys the same artifacts at launch, without any HTTP call, when all of the following hold:

- `COGNISTORE_MANAGED=1` (set only by the Tauri shell — see [Tauri sidecar](./tauri-sidecar.md#environment-variables))
- the app version resolved (not `0.0.0`)
- it is not a first install (`~/.cognistore/.version` or `~/.cognistore/.artifacts-version` exists)
- `~/.cognistore/.artifacts-version` differs from the running version

On success it writes `~/.cognistore/.artifacts-version`. That marker is intentionally separate from `.version`, which stays owned by `/api/upgrade/run` (the only path that also re-embeds and re-checks embedding integrity). Both markers live inside `~/.cognistore/` and are removed by uninstall with the directory.

## Export & Import

### GET /api/export

Unified data export. Returns a JSON file with selected data types.

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `include` | string | `knowledge,plans` | Comma-separated data types to include |

**Response:** JSON file download (`cognistore-export.json`)
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.7",
  "exportedAt": "2026-03-24T12:00:00.000Z",
  "knowledge": [{ "title": "...", "content": "...", "tags": [...], ... }],
  "plans": [{ "title": "...", "content": "...", "tasks": [...], ... }]
}
```

### POST /api/import

Unified data import. Accepts the export format and selectively imports data.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "include": ["knowledge", "plans"],
  "knowledge": [{ "title": "...", "content": "...", "tags": [...], ... }],
  "plans": [{ "title": "...", "content": "...", "tasks": [...], ... }]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "knowledge": { "imported": 10, "skipped": 2, "errors": [] },
  "plans": { "imported": 3, "skipped": 0, "errors": [] }
}
```

System-type entries are automatically converted to `pattern` type on import.

## Uninstall

### POST /api/uninstall

Full teardown: remove configs, skills, data, Ollama, and self-delete app. See [Setup & Uninstall](./setup-uninstall.md) for details.

## Plans CRUD

### GET /api/plans

List plans with optional status and scope filters.

| Query Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | number | 20 | Max plans to return (clamped to 1–200) |
| `offset` | number | 0 | Pagination offset (the dashboard's infinite scroll) |
| `status` | string | — | Filter by status. One value (`?status=active`) or a comma-separated list (`?status=draft,active`), which returns the **union** of them. Valid values: `draft`, `active`, `completed`, `archived`. Omitting the parameter — or sending it empty — applies no status filter. An unrecognised value returns `400`. |
| `scope` | string | — | Filter by exact scope (e.g. `workspace:my-app`); combines with `status` as AND |

**Response:** `Plan[]` · **Errors:** `400` when `status` contains a value outside the plan status vocabulary (the message names the offending values)

### POST /api/plans

Create a new plan.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Migration to v2 API",
  "content": "Step-by-step migration plan...",
  "tags": ["migration", "api"],
  "scope": "workspace:my-app",
  "source": "planning-session",
  "tasks": [
    { "description": "Audit current endpoints", "priority": "high" },
    { "description": "Write migration scripts", "priority": "medium" }
  ],
  "relatedKnowledgeIds": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2"],
  "parentPlanId": "uuid-of-the-plan-this-continues"
}
```

Required: `title`, `content`, `tags`, `scope`, `source`

Optional `parentPlanId` links the plan into an existing chain. Omitted, the plan becomes the ORIGINAL (root) of a new chain. A parent that does not exist does not fail the request — the plan is created as a root.

**Response:** `Plan`

### PUT /api/plans/:id

Update a plan. Only include fields to change. The `archived` status can only be set from the dashboard (not via MCP) — agents are restricted to `draft`, `active`, and `completed` transitions.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "title": "Updated title",
  "parentPlanId": "uuid-of-another-plan"
}
```

`parentPlanId` re-links the plan into another chain; `null` unlinks it, making it the ORIGINAL of its own chain. Unlike `POST /api/plans`, re-linking is strict: pointing a plan at itself, at one of its own descendants, or at a `parentPlanId` that does not exist returns **400** with an explanatory message.

**Response:** `Plan`

### DELETE /api/plans/:id

Delete a plan and all associated tasks and relations. Only the target plan is deleted — the lineage around it is repaired in the same transaction: children are re-parented to the deleted plan's parent, and deleting a chain's ORIGINAL promotes each direct child to the root of its own subtree.

**Response:** `{ success: true }`

### GET /api/plans/:id/chain

Get the full lineage chain the plan belongs to. Accepts any member: the chain's root is resolved first, so a leaf returns the whole chain.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "rootPlanId": "uuid-of-original",
  "chain": [
    { "id": "uuid-of-original", "title": "...", "status": "completed", "scope": "workspace:my-app", "parentPlanId": null, "depth": 0, "isCurrent": false },
    { "id": "uuid-child", "title": "...", "status": "active", "scope": "workspace:my-app", "parentPlanId": "uuid-of-original", "depth": 1, "isCurrent": true }
  ],
  "truncated": false
}
```

Ordered root-first, then by depth (ties broken by creation time). Plan content is never included. `truncated: true` means the chain hit the traversal caps (depth 64, 500 entries).

> **Export/import:** lineage is **instance-local** and does not travel. `GET /api/export` projects an explicit field list for plans (`title`, `content`, `tags`, `scope`, `source`, `status`, `createdAt`, `tasks`) that omits `parentPlanId` / `rootPlanId`, and `POST /api/import` strips them if present anyway — plan ids are regenerated on import, so a foreign id would either dangle or graft onto an unrelated local chain. Imported plans always arrive as standalone ORIGINALs.

### GET /api/plans/:id/relations

Get knowledge entries linked to a plan.

**Response:** `{ entry: KnowledgeEntry, relationType: "input" | "output" }[]`

### POST /api/plans/:id/relations

Link a knowledge entry to a plan. Silently skips system knowledge entries (`type=system`) — returns success but does not create the relation.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "knowledgeId": "uuid-of-entry",
  "relationType": "input"
}
```

**Response:** `{ success: true }`

## Plan Tasks

### GET /api/plans/:planId/tasks

List tasks for a plan, ordered by position.

**Response:** `PlanTask[]`

### POST /api/plans/:planId/tasks

Add a task to a plan.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "description": "Write unit tests",
  "priority": "high",
  "notes": null
}
```

**Response:** `PlanTask`

### PUT /api/plans/tasks/:taskId

Update a task (status, description, priority, notes).

**Body:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "notes": "All tests passing"
}
```

**Response:** `PlanTask`

### DELETE /api/plans/tasks/:taskId

Delete a task. Used by the dashboard's per-task delete button, which branches on `deleted`.

**Response:** `{ "deleted": true }` — `deleted` is `false` when no task with that id existed (still `200`, not `404`).

## Error Handling

### Degraded Mode (503)

If the SDK fails to initialize on startup, the server enters degraded mode:

- All knowledge endpoints return `503 Service Unavailable`
- Setup and health endpoints remain available
- SDK re-initialization retried every 10 seconds
- Once SDK initializes, all endpoints become available

### Standard Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "Entry not found",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```
