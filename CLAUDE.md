# CogniStore - Agent Rules

## Architecture (App-first, Docker-free — current version in `apps/dashboard/package.json`)

- **Entry point**: Tauri desktop app (macOS .dmg, Linux .AppImage/.deb)
- **Database**: SQLite + sqlite-vec (file at `~/.cognistore/knowledge.db`)
- **Embeddings**: Ollama native (auto-installed by app on first launch)
- **Dashboard**: Tauri app (webview + Fastify sidecar)
- **MCP Server**: `@cognistore/mcp-server` npm package (only npm package remaining)
- **CLI**: Deprecated (removed in v0.6.0)
- **Docker**: Removed entirely

## Setup / Uninstall Symmetry (MANDATORY)

The Tauri app's setup wizard creates resources; the uninstall button must remove them.

**Rule:** If setup creates, copies, injects, or modifies anything, uninstall MUST remove or revert it.

| Setup action | Uninstall action |
|---|---|
| Create `~/.cognistore/` directory | Remove directory recursively |
| Create `~/.cognistore/knowledge.db` (SQLite + schema) | Removed with directory |
| Install Ollama via brew/curl | Uninstall Ollama via brew uninstall or remove binary — **conditional**: only when `settings.installedOllama` records that setup installed it AND the user ticks the uninstall checkbox. Ollama is shared; pre-2.5.0 installs have no record, so the default is to keep it |
| Start `ollama serve` | Kill the recorded PID of the process we spawned; `pkill -f "ollama serve"` only as a fallback, gated by the same opt-in (it matches the user's own instances too) |
| Pull embedding model via Ollama API | Remove model via `ollama rm` |
| Pull cleanup LLM model via Ollama API (first consolidation preview) | Remove via `ollama rm <cleanupLlmModel>` — name read from `settings.json` **before** the directory is removed, re-validated, `llama3.2:3b` fallback; skipped when never pulled |
| Inject `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` markers | Remove markers via ConfigManager |
| Inject `~/.github/copilot-instructions.md` markers | Remove markers via ConfigManager |
| Inject `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` markers | Remove markers via ConfigManager |
| Inject `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` markers | Remove markers via ConfigManager |
| Add `cognistore` to `~/.claude/mcp-config.json` | Remove entry via ConfigManager |
| Add `cognistore` to `~/.claude.json` | Remove entry via ConfigManager |
| Add `cognistore` to `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` | Remove entry via ConfigManager |
| Add `cognistore` to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | Remove entry via ConfigManager |
| Inject `mcp__cognistore` server-scope allow rule + a `permissions.deny` entry for each destructive tool (`deleteKnowledge`, `deletePlanTask`) in `~/.claude/settings.json` | Remove the allow rule, our deny entries, and any legacy `mcp__cognistore__*` allow entries via ConfigManager (the user's own deny rules are left alone) |
| Copy global hook scripts to `~/.cognistore/hooks/{claude-code,copilot}/` | Removed with `~/.cognistore` directory |
| Inject hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` (`hooks` key) | Remove cognistore hook entries via `ConfigManager.removeHooks` |
| Write `~/.copilot/hooks/hooks.json` reminder hooks | Remove cognistore entries via `ConfigManager.removeCopilotHooks` |
| Copy Claude skills to `~/.claude/skills/cognistore-*/` | Remove skill directories |
| Copy Copilot skills to `~/.copilot/skills/cognistore-*/` | Remove skill directories |
| App installed in /Applications/ (macOS) | Self-delete via rmSync |
| Store external-provider secret in OS keychain (`set_provider_secret`) | Delete keychain entries via `cleanup_provider_secrets` on uninstall |
| Create `~/.cognistore/providers.json` (external knowledge providers) | Removed with directory |

> **Note (provenance):** Setup injects a per-platform `COGNISTORE_PLATFORM` env var (`claude-code` / `copilot` / `opencode`) into the `env` block of each MCP config entry. This is not a separate resource — it is part of the MCP config entries above and is removed when those entries are removed via ConfigManager, so no extra uninstall row is required.

## Development Rules (MANDATORY)

### Upgrade Scripts
Every feature that changes **any** of the following MUST include an upgrade script that runs automatically when the app updates:
- **Database schema** → add a `.sql` migration file in `packages/core/src/db/migrations/{version}.sql`
- **Skills** → the upgrade system re-copies all skill templates on version change (no extra work needed)
- **Hooks** → global hooks are re-deployed on version change via `deployGlobalHooks()` (idempotent `injectHooks`/`setupCopilotHooks`) in `/api/upgrade/run`, `/api/redeploy`, and the sidecar's startup self-heal (all three share `redeployArtifacts()`). Hook scripts live in `~/.cognistore/hooks/`; settings-file entries are strip-then-append merged so re-runs never duplicate or clobber user hooks
- **Agent instructions** → re-injected automatically on version change
- **MCP configs** → re-written automatically on version change

The upgrade system (`/api/upgrade/run`) compares `~/.cognistore/.version` with the running app version. On mismatch, it re-deploys all artifacts.
The sidecar also self-heals at startup: when `~/.cognistore/.artifacts-version` lags the running version it re-deploys the artifacts alone. That path keeps its own marker because `/api/upgrade/run` owns `.version` and is the only place that re-embeds and resyncs embedding integrity. It requires `COGNISTORE_MANAGED=1` and skips first installs.

> The app version is inlined at build time (`__APP_VERSION__`). Never resolve it by reading a `package.json` relative to `__dirname` — the packaged sidecar runs from `Resources/dist-server/`, and that mistake silently pinned every install at `0.0.0`, disabling upgrades entirely (v2.3.6). An unknown version is never written to `.version`.

### Patch Notes
Every change MUST update `PATCH-NOTES.md` at the project root. Group entries by version and category (features, fixes, improvements). This file is linked from README.md.

### Testing
Every new feature should have corresponding tests in `packages/tests/` (integration/e2e, Playwright). Core logic also gets unit tests in `packages/core/test/` (Vitest, real temp SQLite + stub embedder; helpers in `test/helpers.ts`), and the sidecar's pure modules in `apps/dashboard/server/test/`. The test suite runs on CI for every PR and feature branch push. `pnpm verify` runs everything CI's build-and-test job does (lint with Biome, type-check, build, unit, the root scripts' `node:test` suite, integration, knip once installed), and the `pre-push` hook runs it too.

## Path Resolution

The Tauri sidecar sets environment variables for the Fastify server:
- `SQLITE_PATH` — path to SQLite database
- `OLLAMA_HOST` — Ollama API endpoint
- `DASHBOARD_DIST_PATH` — path to bundled frontend assets
- `TEMPLATES_PATH` — path to bundled skills/config templates
- `COGNISTORE_MANAGED` — `1` only when the Tauri shell launched the sidecar; gates the startup artifact self-heal so tests (which spawn the sidecar against the real `HOME`) never rewrite the developer's agent configs

## Working in this repo (agents)

- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): `cognistore-dev` — map of the codebase, commands, invariants and performance rules; load it before changing code. `cognistore-phase` — executes the next item of a roadmap in `documentation/plans/`.
- **Subagents** (`.claude/agents/`): `perf-reviewer` (event-loop blocking, full scans, write contention) and `invariants-reviewer` (migrations, patch notes, setup/uninstall symmetry, templates). Run both on a diff before committing.
- **Active roadmap**: `documentation/plans/2026-11-performance-e-curadoria.md` — performance (the sidecar freezes on large DBs) + automatic knowledge curation with the local LLM. Tick items and append to its execution log as you go.
- **DB health**: `node scripts/diagnose-db.mjs [path]` — read-only size/row breakdown of the knowledge DB (telemetry vs knowledge, duplicates, cleanup state).

### Performance rules (MANDATORY)

The sidecar is a single Node process and better-sqlite3 is synchronous; the DB file is shared with one MCP server process per agent session.
- Never load whole tables with `content` (`listAll()`) or loop one query per row in a request handler or timer.
- Read paths never write synchronously; batch writes in one transaction.
- Work that can exceed ~50 ms on a 10k-entry base runs as a background job (worker/chunked with yields), never inline.
- No sync fs calls in timers. New queries on growing tables need an index or a rollup.
